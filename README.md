# Bitcoin Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to predict Bitcoin prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately forecast the future price of Bitcoin based on past trends.

## Project Overview

Bitcoin price prediction is a common problem in financial forecasting. This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics to build a model for predicting Bitcoin prices. 

The project workflow includes:
- Data Collection
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Selection
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation

## Algorithms Used
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical Bitcoin prices, which include attributes such as:
- Date
- Open Price
- High Price
- Low Price
- Close Price
- Volume
- Market Cap

## Libraries and Tools
The following Python libraries are used in this project:
- `Pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- `NumPy` for numerical computations.
- `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.
- `Scikit-learn` for implementing machine learning models.
